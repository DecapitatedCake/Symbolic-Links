# Symbolic-Links
This script aims to create symbolic links in the userâ€™s home directory and only in that directory. We often find that we have broken links elsewhere in the system, causing instability and odd behavior. In Windows, most users know that to create a shortcut, right-click on the file and select "Create Shortcut." This script does something similar.
